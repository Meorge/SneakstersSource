# Sneaksters Source Code
Sneaksters is a game about using teamwork to steal treasure!
Players must take up one of two jobs - the Hackers and the Thieves.

The Thieves' objective is to sneak though a labyrinth and collect
Gemstones, but they don't have any idea what the layout of the map is.

The Hackers, on the other hand, have an overhead view of the whole
area, but no direct control over the Thieves' movements.

The two groups must communicate in order to escape without getting busted.

## What's this repository?
As I recall, this game has been in on-and-off development
since around fall of 2018. I've learned a lot while working on it!
As a side effect of this being such a big learning project for me,
I've found it difficult to continue to work on. As a result, I've
decided to publish the source code as a standalone repository for viewing.

Note that, since assets aren't included, you won't be able to run this as
a Unity project! The purpose of publishing this is just to show how
the game worked mechanically.

## Will Sneaksters return?
Maybe someday! If so, it'll probably be in the form of a new game/remake,
not building on the code here.
